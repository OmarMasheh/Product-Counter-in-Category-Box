Product Counter
This feature shows the amount of active products counted online within a category and subcategories child's and so on in the category box. 
It was part in early OSCommerce Version 2.2 but was removed in Phoenix version sometime. 
The feature is helpful for shop visitors to see how many products are available in a category.

This feature works with Phoenix 1.0.8.5 
It was tested with Phoenix 1.0.8.5
