I just just fixed to work with Phoenix 1.0.8.4

Product Counter
This feature shows the amount of active products counted online within a category and subcategories child's and so on in the category box. 
The feature is helpful for shop visitors to see how many products are available in a category.

It was tested with Phoenix 1.0.8.4 and 1.0.8.5
