Product Counter

This feature shows the amount of active products counted online within a category and subcategories child's and so on in the category box. 
It was part in early OSCommerce Version 2.2 but was removed in Phoenix version sometime. 
The feature is helpful for shop visitors to see how many products are available in a category.

The software was written by a professional known OS commerce developer, I decided, with the developer's consent, 
to make the feature freely available. Please upload into your store directory, there is only 1 file and there should 
no files being overwritten.
